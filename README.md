### Contribute

This is the first project I had to use npm ever so sorry about the mess.

-   Fork this repo and clone it to your device.
-   Install modules with `npm install`
-   The file structure is as described above.
-   The main CSS file for this project (`style.css`) is compiled from the `style.scss` file located in the same directory.
    -   To code some CSS, please modify the .scss file,
    -   To compile .scss file to .css, open Git Bash in your root directory and run `npx sass assets/css/style.scss assets/css/style.css --watch`.
-   After making modifications, all you need to do is push and the GitHub actions file I set up will automatically build it.
-   Then submit a pull request.

### Submit a product

First, please make sure that the product you want to submit is not in the [excluded products list](https://github.com/oneminch/encryptedlist/wiki/Excluded-Products).
I haven't set up a proper way to submit product information yet. So use this,

1. Add necessary data to [form](https://oneminch.github.io/encryptedlist/creator) (name, description, url, ...) and hit 'Generate'.
2. An object is generated at the bottom of the page; Continue submiting other products (if any) and all the objects generated will be listed at the bottom of the page.
3. Copy + Paste the generated object(s) to `product_list` array in [data.js](https://github.com/oneminch/encryptedlist/tree/master/src/data.js)
4. Stage your changes, commit and push. GitHub Actions will automatically build the files.
5. Submit pull request
